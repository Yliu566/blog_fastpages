On June 28th 2022, I started to blog by using fastpages. [fn] This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), An easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.[/fn]

The first idea of this blog is to put everything I find interesting or useful about Cheminformatics here. 

Hopefully it turns out nice and clean.
