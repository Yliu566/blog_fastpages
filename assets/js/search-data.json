            "content": "Here are some notes about basic syntax of markdown. Built with from Grav and Hugo . Headings . Headings are with number sign (#) in front of a word or a phrase. The number of # signs indicate the level of the headings. For example, first-level heading is using ‘#’ and second level heading is using ‘##’. Remember to add space between “#” and your word or phrase. . Here is the example: . Header three . Header four . Header five . Header six . Emphasis . In general, we need to add emphasis to the content by using bold or italic texts. . Bold . Bold type is created by add two asterisk (**) around the letter without space.eg: . I am bold text. . Italic . Italic type is created by add one asterisk(*) or underscore(_) around the letter without space.Eg: . Use* : I am italic text. . or . use _ : I am italic text as well. . Bold and Italic . This type is created by adding three asterisk (***) around the letters without space. Eg: . I am both bold and italic texts. . Blockquotes . Blockquote is created by adding a &gt; in front of a sentence or paragraph. . Here shows the rendered output of a blocquoted texts. Here is a nested blockquoted texts. . URLs . write down links . When writing a link, put angle brackets around the link. (&lt; url &gt;) . Here is a link to this blog: https://yliu566.github.io/ . super link to a website . use format” [Name_of_the_webste](website link address)”. Eg: . Please enjoy reading my blog . Lists . Ordered list . Ordered list is created by add numbers with a period to each line items. The following is an example. . First item | Second item | Third item | Fourth item subitem 1 | subitem 2 | | Unordered list . Unordered list is created by add dash (-), asterisk (*) or plus sign (+) in front each items. . First item | Second item | Third item | Fourth item subitem 1 | subitem 2 | . | . Tables . Table 1 . Entry Item   . item1 | 1111 | Description of the item in the list | . item2 | 2222 | Description of the item in the list | . item3 | 3333 | Description of the item in the list | . Table 2 . Header1 Header2 Header3 . cell1 | cell2 | cell3 | . cell4 | cell5 | cell6 | . cell1 | cell2 | cell3 | . cell4 | cell5 | cell6 | . Foot1 | Foot2 | Foot3 | . Adding images . how to add images? . Buttons . Make any link standout more when applying the .btn class. . Notices . Watch out! You can also add notices by appending {: .notice} to a paragraph. . eg: . You can also add notices by appending{.notice} . HTML Tags . Address Tag . 1 Infinite Loop Cupertino, CA 95014 United States Anchor Tag (aka. Link) . This is an example of a link. . Abbreviation Tag . The abbreviation CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets”. . Cite Tag . “Code is poetry.” —Automattic . Code Tag . You will learn later on in these tests that word-wrap: break-word; will be your best friend. . Strike Tag . This tag will let you strikeout text. . Emphasize Tag . The emphasize tag should italicize text. . Insert Tag . This tag should denote inserted text. . Keyboard Tag . This scarcely known tag emulates keyboard text, which is usually styled like the &lt;code&gt; tag. . Preformatted Tag . This tag styles large blocks of code. . .post-title { margin: 0 0 5px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 38px; line-height: 1.2; and here&#39;s a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows; } . Quote Tag . Developers, developers, developers… –Steve Ballmer . Strong Tag . This tag shows bold text. . Subscript Tag . Getting our science styling on with H2O, which should push the “2” down. . Superscript Tag . Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton’s E = MC2, which should lift the 2 up. . Variable Tag . This allows you to denote variables. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
